The AI engineer successfully initiated the Healer pharmacy marketplace application, starting from a base React/FastAPI/MongoDB template. Initial discussions established complex requirements for three distinct user roles (Customer, Pharmacy, Driver), including advanced authentication, real-time tracking, multiple payment methods, and dynamic order management. The AI engineer proposed a phased approach, which the user then pushed to a build all phases together strategy. The core architectural decision to split the application into three separate frontend apps (CustomerApp, PharmacyApp, DriverApp) was made after an initial integrated approach failed to meet the user's vision. Throughout the process, the AI engineer made extensive backend () and frontend (, individual page components) modifications, addressing user feedback on authentication logic, data storage, and UI functionality. A significant challenge involved debugging React context and import errors after the app splitting, along with fixing backend syntax errors and refining the forgot password flow to meet stringent user requirements. The trajectory ends with the AI engineer preparing to implement Google Sign-in and a comprehensive profile/verification system across all three apps.

<product_requirements>
The user requested Healer, a Blinkit-like app for pharmacies in India, displaying product search, delivery time, distance, and comparative pricing. The MVP needed to be simple but usable.

Key features and implementation decisions so far include:
-   **User Roles & Authentication:** Three roles (Customer, Pharmacy Owner, Driver) with JWT username/password login for business accounts, and multi-option logins (Google, Phone+OTP, Apple - though only Google/Phone+OTP integrations were discussed) for customers. Password validation (min 6 chars, special char), email validation, see/unsee password, and a forgot password flow (email -> OTP -> new/confirm password) for all apps.
-   **Core Features Priority:** Initially, the pharmacy side was prioritized, but the user opted for all features to be built concurrently. The app was later restructured into three separate frontend applications: Healer (Customer), Healer Business (Pharmacy), and Healer Delivery (Driver).
-   **Payment:** Cash on Delivery (COD) for orders within 10km, with credit/debit card, UPI, and PayPal integration. Delivery fees calculation and total price display in INR.
-   **Maps & Location:** Real-time map, driver tracking, traffic-based Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).
-   **Order Management:** Full order tracking with real-time status updates, pharmacy accept/reject functionality, customer cancellation (free for 2 mins, then dynamic charges), driver options for pickup/delivery, in-app chat/calling, and photo proof of delivery.
-   **Customer App:** Address and payment options, points system with rewards/discounts, and a Healer Pro membership (priority, no delivery fees).
-   **Driver App:** Secure profile with Aadhaar card verification, earnings page/history, reviews, state-based rates, and rewards.
-   **Data Storage:** All user, pharmacy, medicine, order, driver, earnings, and review data is stored in a MongoDB database (healer_db).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Shadcn UI:** Used for frontend components to ensure a modern and consistent UI/UX.
-   **Authentication:** JWT, Google OAuth (via Emergentintegrations), Phone OTP (via Emergentintegrations).
-   **Payment Gateway:** Razorpay, PayPal (via Emergentintegrations).
-   **Database:** MongoDB, with Pydantic models for data validation and UUIDs for object IDs.
-   **Real-time Features:** Planned WebSockets for live tracking and order updates.
-   **Containerization:** Kubernetes environment, supervisor for service control.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure initially, which was then refactored into a single backend supporting three distinct frontend applications.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance:** This is the core of the FastAPI backend, handling all API routes, database interactions, authentication logic, order processing, pricing calculations, and user management for all three roles.
    -   **Changes:** Initially a complete rewrite to establish multi-role support, then extensive modifications to add:
        -   Pydantic models for , , , , .
        -   API endpoints for these new models.
        -   Pricing calculation functions and integration into order creation.
        -   Password validation, email validation, and error messages for authentication.
        -   Forgot password endpoints and logic, including password confirmation.
        -   Support for Google OAuth and Phone OTP through Emergentintegrations.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Stores environment variables crucial for backend operation.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to include  (healer_db), , , , , , , .
-   :
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes:** Rewritten to act as a router to the three distinct applications (, , ) housed in the  directory.
-   , , :
    -   **Importance:** These files serve as the root components for each of the three separate client applications, encapsulating their routing and context.
    -   **Changes:** Created to establish distinct application contexts and routing for each user role.
-    (e.g., , , ):
    -   **Importance:** Handle user registration, login, and password reset for each specific app.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented with password visibility toggles, required field indicators, explicit authentication failure reasons, and an updated forgot password flow requiring email, OTP verification, and new/confirm password fields.
-   , , , , :
    -   **Importance:** Initial dashboard and feature pages. After refactoring, relevant components were likely moved or re-contextualized within the new  directory structure.
    -   **Changes:** Initially created, then involved fixes for escape characters and import paths to integrate correctly within their respective app contexts.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing robust authentication and user management features across the three Healer applications.

Specifically, the following was addressed:
1.  **Backend Enhancements for Authentication:**
    *   Added password validation (minimum length, special characters) and email helper functions to .
    *   Improved the register and login endpoints in  to provide better validation feedback and specific error messages.
    *   Implemented a comprehensive forgot password flow in  requiring email, OTP verification, and subsequent new password and confirm password inputs.
    *   Added endpoints for customer addresses and payment methods.
2.  **Frontend Authentication UI/UX (Customer App):**
    *   Updated  to include:
        *   Password visibility toggle (eye icon).
        *   Required field indicators.
        *   A functional Forgot Password? link initiating the new flow.
    *   Corrected the  file to resolve previous escaping issues.
3.  **Frontend Authentication UI/UX (Pharmacy & Driver Apps):**
    *   Updated  and  with the same improvements as the Customer Auth page (password toggle, required fields, forgot password link).
    *   Crucially, the  error in  (and implicitly, other dashboards) was debugged and fixed, stemming from an incorrect import or circular dependency, which involved removing an declare -x DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive"

At the end of the trajectory, the pharmacy authentication page () was confirmed to be working beautifully with the new branding, required field indicators, password toggle, and forgot password link. The AI engineer was about to start implementing Google Sign-in and a comprehensive profile/verification system.
